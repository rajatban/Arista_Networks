capacity matrix for AP1, AP2, AP3, AP4, JT

calculate max capacity possible

check if tile for AP2 and AP4 are same
	if so select second best
	take highest one as second tile
	if same choose any

check if conbine AP2 and AP4 capacity is better than JT
	take the highest value to choose SAPI or JT

check if AP1, AP2 and above tile are same
	if so select second best

Alocate APs to tiles accordingly

repeat the steps while excluding selected tiles
